# NS3 Network Topologies

This repository contains implementations of five network topologies using NS-3 and NetAnim.

## Topologies Implemented

1. Star Topology (16 Nodes)
2. Bus Topology (20 Nodes)
3. Ring Topology (18 Nodes)
4. Binary Tree Topology (15 Nodes)
5. Full Mesh Topology (16 Nodes)

## Tools Used

- NS-3 Network Simulator
- NetAnim for visualization
- C++ programming

## Description

Each topology was implemented with 15–25 nodes.
All simulations were visualized using NetAnim.
